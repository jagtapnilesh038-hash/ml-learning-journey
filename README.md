# 📘 ML Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Journey** 🚀
This repository tracks my daily progress in learning **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

---

## 📅 Day 1 – Environment Setup & First Dataset

* Installed essential Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `jupyter`.
* Created my first Jupyter Notebook: **Day1-Intro-ML.ipynb**.
* Loaded and explored the **Iris dataset** (150 samples, 4 features, 1 target).
* Learned that ML data usually has:

  * **Features** → Input variables (e.g., sepal length, petal width).
  * **Target** → Output label (flower species).

✅ Notebook: [Day1-Intro-ML.ipynb](Day1-Intro-ML.ipynb)

## 🚀 Goal of this Repo

* Build strong foundations in **ML & AI**.
* Upload **daily Jupyter notebooks** with code + notes.
* Create a portfolio that showcases ML projects for freelancing and jobs.
